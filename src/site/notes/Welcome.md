Hi!
Many Thanks to [the Digital Garden for Obsidian](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

> [!LEARN] About
> This website is a one man operation that I had made for myself seeing that there was no progress to make [NerfStudio](https://docs.nerf.studio/index.html) work easily with windows

Summary for Nerf engines I was able to make work easily:
* [[Nerfstudio/NerfStudio\|NerfStudio]]
	* [[Nerfstudio/Lerf\|Lerf]]
