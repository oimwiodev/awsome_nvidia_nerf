Hi!
Many Thanks to [the Digital Garden for Obsidian](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
This website is a one man operation that I had made for myself seeing that there was no progress to make [NerfStudio](https://docs.nerf.studio/quickstart/installation.html) work easily with windows
> [!PROOF]
> Nerfstudio on Windows is less tested and more fragile, due to way more moving parts outside of Nerfstudioâ€™s control.  
> The instructions also tend to break over time as updates to different Windows packages happen.  
> Installing Nerfstudio on Linux instead is recommended if you have the option.  
> Alternatively, installing Nerfstudio under WSL2 (temporary unofficial guide [here](https://gist.github.com/SharkWipf/0a3fc1be3ea88b0c9640db6ce15b44b9), not guaranteed to work) is also an option, but this comes with its own set of caveats.

Summary for Nerf engines I was able to make work easily:
* [[Nerfstudio/NerfStudio\|NerfStudio]]
